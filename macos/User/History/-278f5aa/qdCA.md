# Notes for next version

## Rethink the way we build meta objects
step.build(object) is not so convenient nor ituitive since we can access object.build directly
maybe object.build(step) is more adapted ?
how manage multiple object build in same step ?
maybe the props 'root' should be remove in favor of Root() object ?

## Use build_runner to facilitate creation of customs bricks

```dart
// parse annotation to function to generate code builder expression
// code is typed and fully functional in ipr side,
// build runner analyzer extract the body
// string var are replaced
// string is constructed as expression to be sued inside generator 
@FormFieldSeed<int, TextEditingController>(
  controllerInitialization: (int $value) => TextEditingController(
    text: $value.toString(),
  ),
  accessData: (TextEditingController $name) => int.parse($name.text),
)
```


```dart
//declaration is copied to output dir
@FormFieldSeed<int, TextEditingController>(...)
class MultiLineTextFormField extends StatelessWidget {
  ...
}
```

```dart
// params are extracted from constructor
@seed<MultiLineTextFormField>(constructor: 'namedConstructor')
final multiLineTextFormField = FormFieldSeed(
  value: int,
  controller: TextEditingController,
  controllerInitialization: 'TextEditingController(text: initialValue?.$name.toString(),)',
  accessData: 'int.parse($name.text)',
);
```

Form field
```dart
@FormFieldSeed<int>(
value: int,
controller: TextEditingController,
controllerInitialization: 'TextEditingController(text: initialValue?.$name.toString(),)',
accessData: 'int.parse($name.text)',
params: {
  'hint': String,
  'validator': String? Function(String?),
  'decorations': InputDecoration,
})
const multiLineTextFormField = r"""
MultiLineTextFormField(
  controller: {{ controller }},
  hint: {{ hint }},
  validator: {{ validatorÂ }},
  decorations: {{ decorations }},
)""";
```

Form Section
```dart
// children is shared for all form sections, no need to specify it
@FormSectionSeed({
  'required': bool,
})
const myFormSection = """
CustomWidget(
  required: {{ required }}
  children: {{ children }},
)""";
```

## Make bonemeal meta object synchronous
It's tedious to await each time

## Introduce a "Meta-object tree" parent lookup similar to flutter's InheritedWidget
The goal is to access parent widget data from childs
use case:
  Config meta-object, similar to flutter's theme, used to define default behaviors for objects.
  ex: TextFormFields should use label or hint by default ?
  ex: use l10n ?

## Generator should feature a header system that support:
  - separated header for ipr/output
  - ability to influence header from inside and outside the model, depending on the build type (ipr/output)
use cases:
a generated model have 'part of' directive inside output, but not inside ipr (target part doesn't exist in ipr).
the part of should target an arbitrary file.
inside the ipr, model should generate required imports directives

## Formater system
A formater can be setup for a set of file type
Formater should also run on header
Manage header duplicata

# Note for Form
Can be cool to have ability to use a hook to define a section instead of having to inherit from FormSection;

Form is composed by the following elements:
  Form:
    Main user interface.
    Form is composed by one or more form section.
    Form define the spacing between sections.
    Form collects all dependencies and add the them to the top of the files (controller and snapshot are imported using part directive)
  FormSection:
    FormSection is composed by a set of FormFields or FormSections
    It define nescessary spacing inside this section
    It collect all sub-sections and fields dependencies and expose them to Form
    It should be relatively easy to make new types of section

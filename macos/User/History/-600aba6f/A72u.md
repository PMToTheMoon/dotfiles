bonemeal is a code generator that generate complete project output at once.
Generation is based on a work directory called intermediate project representation. The IPR (intermediate project representation) contain definition files written in yaml format and custom dart code called hooks that will be integrated to the generated project output.
To make sure hooks are written in a valid dart environnement, bonemeal will generate hooks dependencies inside the IPR.
The bonemeal workflow will follow theses steps:
First, provide initial project definitions (skeleton.yaml, ...)
Second, generate IPR context using bonemeal build ipr
Third, implement code hooks


bonemeal is a dart package that comes with a CLI.
bonemeal CLI is used to:
  - create new [bonemeal projects]()
  - export generated output based on bonemeal config. see [bonemeal.yaml config file]().
CLI scripts are located inside the bin/ folder.

bonemeal package contains builders necessary to generate intermediate project representation and output project.
builder are using the [dart build system]().
builders sources are located inside the lib/ folder

# unusable_player
Unusable player is a mobile music player developed using Flutter.
It's a portfolio project, it's not mean to be used in real life.
Its focus on visuals instead of usability and performance, that's why the project is called "Unusable Player".

**The project is based on Sulton Handaya's artwork:**

## Caution
This project isn't representative of my actual coding standard.
If you take inspiration from this source code, keep a critical eye. Some part of this project are better than others.
If I should restar this project today, I would:
- Use Bloc (and state_machine_bloc üòè) instead of GetX
- Use a feature based project organization
Animation parts are especially messy. Use at your own risks.

# unusable_player
Unusable player is a mobile music player developed using Flutter.
It's a portfolio project, it's not mean to be used in real life.
Its focus on visuals instead of usability and performance, that's why the project is called "Unusable Player".

**The project is based on Sulton Handaya's artwork:**
